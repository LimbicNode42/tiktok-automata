They're not just talking about acquiring smaller startups anymore - they're going all-in with a major player. And the reason? Because Zuckerberg is FED UP with their lack of progress. I mean, have you seen the latest chatbots from OpenAI? It's like they're speaking human language! Meanwhile, Meta's trying to catch up with their own models.
