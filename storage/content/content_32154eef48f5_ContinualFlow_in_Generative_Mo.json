Our method leverages an energy-based reweighting loss to softly subtract undesired regions of the data distribution without retraining from scratch or requiring direct access to the samples to be unlearned. Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning process. We prove that this induces gradients equivalent to Flow Matching toward a soft mass-subtracted target, and validate the framework through experiments on 2D and image domains, supported by interpretable visualizations and quantitative evaluations.
