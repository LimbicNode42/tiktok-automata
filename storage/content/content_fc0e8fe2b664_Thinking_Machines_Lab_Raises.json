  "content": "Thinking Machines Lab, the secretive AI startup founded by OpenAI\u2019s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, has closed a $2 billion seed round , according to The Financial Times . The deal values the 6-month-old startup at $10 billion. The company\u2019s work remains unclear . The startup has leveraged Murati\u2019s reputation and other high-profile AI researchers who have joined the team to attract investors in what could be the largest seed round in history. According to sources familiar with the deal cited by the FT, Andreessen Horowitz led the round, with participation from Sarah Guo\u2019s Conviction Partners. Murati left OpenAI last September after leading the development of some of the company\u2019s most prominent AI products, including ChatGPT, DALL-E, and voice mode. Several of her former OpenAI colleagues have joined the new startup, including co-founder John Schulman. Murati is one of a handful of executives who left OpenAI after raising concerns about CEO Sam Altman\u2019s leadership in 2023. When the board ousted Altman in November of that year, Murati served as interim CEO before Altman was quickly reinstated.",
