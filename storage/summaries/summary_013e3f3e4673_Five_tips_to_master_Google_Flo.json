With more than 35 million videos generated since launching in May, it's inspiring to see you bring your ideas to life as cinematic clips and scenes using Veo . To help you push your creative boundaries even further, we\u2019re sharing a few tips and features to help you get the most out of Flow. 1. Start with a detailed prompt; use Gemini to help The foundation of a great AI-generated video lies in the quality of the prompt. While simple prompts can yield impressive results, detailed descriptions provide greater creative control. Consider these elements when crafting your prompt: Subject and action: Clearly identify your characters or objects and describe their movements. Composition and camera motion: Frame your shot with terms like \"wide shot\" or \"close-up,\" and direct the camera with instructions like \"tracking shot\" or \"aerial view.\" Location and lighting: Don't just name a place; paint a picture. The lighting and environment set the entire mood. Instead of \"a room,\" try describing \"a dusty attic filled with forgotten treasures, a single beam of afternoon light cutting through a grimy window.\" Alternative styles: Flow is not limited to realistic visual styles. You can explore a wide array of animation styles to match your story's tone. Experiment with prompts that specify aesthetics like \"stop motion,\" \"knitted animation\" or \"clay animation.\" Audio and dialogue: While still an experimental feature, you can generate audio with your video by selecting Veo 3 in the model picker. You can then prompt the model to create ambient noise, specific sound effects, or even generate dialogue by including it in your prompt, optionally specifying details like tone, emotion, or accents. Note that speech is less likely to be generated if the requested dialogue doesn\u2019t fit in the 8-second clip, or if it involves minors. You can use Gemini to refine prompts, expand on an idea or be a brainstorming companion. Here\u2019s a Gemini prompt to get you started: You are the world\u2019s most intuitive visual communicator and expert prompt engineer. You possess a deep understanding of cinematic language, narrative structure, emotional resonance, the critical concept of filmic coverage and the specific capabilities of Google\u2019s Veo AI model. Your mission is to transform my conceptual ideas into meticulously crafted, narrative-style text-to-video prompts that are visually breathtaking and technically precise for Veo. If you\u2019re using Gemini to help generate multiple clips that have scene consistency, you\u2019ll need to explicitly tell Gemini to repeat all essential details from prior prompts. 2. Create your ingredients Before you create a scene, you need your characters and props. In Flow, these are your ingredients. An ingredient is a consistent visual element \u2014 a character, an object or a stylistic reference \u2014 that you can create from a text-to-image prompt with the help of Imagen or by uploading an image. You can add up to three ingredients per prompt by selecting \u201cIngredients to Video\u201d and then generating or uploading the desired images. Ingredients to Video only works with Veo 2, and we\u2019re working to bring this capability to Veo 3. 3. Animate your world with Ingredients to Video Once you have your ingredients, it's time to bring them to life. The Ingredients to Video feature lets you use your pre-defined characters, objects and styles as a consistent reference in your video prompts. This is where you get your jellyfish to start swimming around in the zebra-print backseat of that taxi. 4. Set the scene with Frames to Video This feature gives you precise control over your shot's composition by letting you define the starting frame. By uploading an image or using a frame from a previous generation, you can ensure your scene begins or concludes exactly as you envision it, making it great for smooth transitions. 5. Build your story with Scenebuilder The Scenebuilder is your in-Flow storyboard, where you assemble individual clips into a complete narrative. It includes powerful tools for maintaining your story\u2019s flow, including: Jump To: Transition a character or object to a completely new setting while preserving their appearance from the previous shot. It's like teleporting your subject, saving you from recreating them for a new scene. Extend: If a great moment ends too soon, Extend easily lengthens your clip. It analyzes the final frames and continues the action, letting your shot breathe without a full regeneration. Jump To and Extend only work with Veo 2, and we\u2019re working to make these capabilities available with Veo 3. Use these tips to make the most of your creative potential and bring your cinematic visions to life. Start creating with Flow , now available for Google AI",
  "tiktok_summary": "The tech world just had its biggest plot twist yet: Google's AI-powered assistant, which was supposed to make our lives easier, might actually be making us dumber. The author claims that Google's AI-powered tools are being used so widely that they're starting to change the way we think. The CEO explains that these AI-driven assistants are learning from our habits and adapting to our needs, but at what cost? According to the writer, most people don't realize that these AI-powered tools are collecting an astonishing amount of data about us. It's not just your search history, folks - it's everything from how often you check your email to what songs you listen to on Spotify. Wait, what? Your entire life is being tracked and analyzed without your knowledge! But here's the thing: some experts say that's not necessarily a bad thing. According to the study, AI-powered tools can help us become more efficient and productive. They can even predict our behavior and prevent potential problems before they happen. Plot twist - it gets even crazier: did you know that Google's AI-powered tools have been trained on over 10 million years' worth of human conversations? That's right, folks, your every thought is being used to improve these AI systems. But what does this mean for our future? Are we creating a world where humans are no longer needed? Or are we just trading one form of automation for another? The CEO argues that AI-powered tools will only continue to evolve and improve, but we need to stay ahead of the curve. We need to understand how these tools work and take control of our own data.",
