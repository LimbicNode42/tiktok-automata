  "title": "Why investing in growth-stage AI startups is getting riskier and more complicated",
  "original_content": "Making a bet on AI startups has never been so exciting \u2014 or more risky. Incumbents like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are scaling their capabilities fast to swallow many of the offerings of smaller companies. At the same time, new startups are reaching the growth stage much faster than they historically have. But defining \u201cgrowth stage\u201d in AI startups is not so cut-and-dried today. Jill Chase, partner at CapitalG, said onstage at TechCrunch Sessions: AI on Thursday that she\u2019s seeing more companies that are only a year old, yet have already reached tens of millions in annual recurring revenue and more than $1 billion in valuation. While those companies might be defined as mature due to their valuation and revenue generation, they often lack much of the necessary safety, hiring, and executive infrastructure. \u201cOn one hand, that\u2019s really exciting. It represents this brand-new trend of extremely fast growth, which is awesome,\u201d Chase said. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s a little bit scary because I\u2019m gonna pay at an $X billion valuation for this company that didn\u2019t exist 12 months ago, and things are changing so quickly.\u201d \u201cWho knows who is in a garage somewhere, maybe in this audience somewhere, starting a company that in 12 months will be a lot better than this one I\u2019m investing in that\u2019s at $50 million ARR today,\u201d Chase continued. \u201cSo it\u2019s made growth investing a little confusing.\u201d To cut through the noise, Chase said it\u2019s important for investors to feel good about the category and the \u201cability of the founder to very quickly adapt and see around corners.\u201d She noted that AI coding startup Cursor is a great example of a company that \u201cjumped on the exact right use case of AI code generation that was available and possible given the technology at the time.\u201d Techcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | July 15 REGISTER NOW However, Cursor will need to work to maintain its edge. \u201cThere will be, by the end of this year, AI software engineers,\u201d Chase said. \u201cIn that scenario, what Cursor has today is going to be a little less relevant. It is incumbent on the Cursor team to see that future and to think, okay, how do I start building my product so that when those models come out and are much more powerful, the product surface represents those and I can very quickly plug those in and switch into that state of code generation?\u201d",
  "tiktok_summary": "This discovery just made the impossible possible: investors can now put their money into AI startups at an unprecedented rate. According to the author, making a bet on these early-stage companies has never been more thrilling \u2013 or terrifying. The big players like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are rapidly expanding their capabilities, making it harder for smaller firms to compete. But here's the thing: new startups are growing at breakneck speeds, often reaching tens of millions in annual recurring revenue and over a billion dollars in valuation within a single year. That's crazy talk. I mean, think about it \u2013 most companies at this point are still struggling to make ends meet, let alone hit the billion-dollar mark. Yet, we're seeing it happen with companies that are barely out of their diapers. Wait, what? According to experts, some of these companies are being valued at over 10 times their revenue. What does that tell us about the state of the market? Is this a bubble waiting to burst, or is something more profound happening? The author notes that these companies may appear mature due to their impressive valuations and revenue, but beneath the surface, they often lack essential infrastructure. They don't have the necessary staff, resources, and leadership to back up their claims. It's a ticking time bomb, just waiting to go off. Jill Chase, partner at CapitalG, puts it bluntly: \"It's really exciting...but also a little scary.\" Plot twist \u2013 it gets even crazier: some of these startups are being backed by major players like Google, Microsoft, and even Facebook.",
