  "original_content": "When Cluely, a startup claiming to be building a product that helps people \u201ccheat\u201d on everything, announced that it raised a $15 million Series A financing round from Andreessen Horowitz, some people on X criticized the VC firm for backing the controversial company. After all, Cluely isn\u2019t just offering a product that may have questionable uses; the startup has also become famous for using what many people call rage-bait marketing. But Cluely\u2019s ability to grab attention is precisely what attracted a16z to the startup. Even before meeting Cluely\u2019s founder Roy Lee, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s partner Bryan Kim thought that startups need new marketing tactics in the AI era. Kim, like many investors, previously thought that building a superb \u201cartisan\u201d product with highly desired features was the key to a startup\u2019s lasting success, he explained on the latest a16z podcast episode .

How does Lee explain why his polarizing marketing approach has generated so much buzz? \u201cMost people don\u2019t know how to make viral content,\u201d Lee said on the podcast. \u201cEveryone on X is trying to [sound] like the most intellectual, thoughtful person.
