  "original_content": "11.ai demonstrates what is possible when you combine voice-first interaction with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to give an AI assistant the ability to take action. Voice assistants have long promised to revolutionize how we interact with technology, but they've been limited to answering questions. While impressive for conversation, they don't take meaningful action in your daily workflow. Introducing 11ai Voice-first productivity Traditional voice assistants face limitations when it comes to actually accomplishing something meaningful. They can answer questions but can\u2019t research new findings based on supplied data. 11ai is our foray intro addressing this by connecting directly to the tools you use everyday through MCP integration. Here's what you might be able to accomplish with just your voice: Morning planning: \"Plan my day and add my priority tasks to Linear\" Customer research: \"Use Perplexity to research our prospect meeting today and summarize their recent funding\" Project management: \"Search our Linear issues for the API bug and create a new ticket for the follow-up work\" Team communication: \"Catch me up on yesterday's Slack messages in the engineering channel\" 11ai attempts to understand context across your tools and take sequential actions. When you ask it to research a customer, the goal is for it to search through your connected systems, find relevant data, and potentially act on that information by updating your CRM or sending a team update. MCP integration MCP provides a standardized way for AI assistants to integrate with external APIs with a uniform protocol. ElevenLabs Conversational AI now also has built-in support for MCP \u2014 letting AI agents connect to services like Salesforce, HubSpot, Gmail, Zapier and more seamlessly. We provide out-of-the-box integrations for: Perplexity : Research capabilities with real-time web data Linear : Issue tracking and project management Slack : Team communication and message management Notion : Task and knowledge management with more integrations being released every week. Beyond these ready-made integrations, 11ai supports custom MCP servers. If your team has built internal tools or uses specialized software, you can connect your own MCP servers to extend 11ai's capabilities into your unique workflow. Getting started with 11ai The MCP architecture ensures that all connections are secure and that 11ai only has access to the specific actions you've authorized. Each integration can be configured with appropriate permissions, giving you full control over what your AI assistant can and cannot do. Powered by ElevenLabs Conversational AI 11ai serves as a proof of concept showcasing what developers can build with ElevenLabs Conversational AI, our low-latency platform for creating scalable voice agents. This demonstration shows how the underlying technology can be used to create sophisticated voice-first applications with real-world integrations. Key platform features include: Ultra-low latency: Real-time conversation with minimal delay Multimodal support: Voice and text interaction in the same session Integrated RAG: Access to external knowledge bases with context-aware responses Automatic language detection: Seamless multilingual conversations Enterprise-ready: HIPAA compliance and enterprise-grade security 11ai demonstrates how these capabilities combine to create natural, productive voice interactions. The platform handles the complex orchestration of speech processing, intent understanding, tool integration, and response generation \u2014 all while maintaining the conversational flow that makes voice interaction feel natural. You can choose from over 5,000 voices in our library or create a custom voice clone that sounds like you. This personalization makes your AI assistant feel like a natural extension of your workflow rather than a generic bot. Getting started with 11ai 11ai is available as a proof of concept in alpha starting today. During this experimental phase, we're offering free access to help us gather feedback and demonstrate the potential of voice-first AI assistants. To get started: Sign up at 11.ai: Create your account and complete the setup process Choose your voice: Select from our library of 5,000+ voices or create a custom voice clone Connect your tools : Add integrations for Google Calendar, Linear, Slack, Perplexity, and any custom MCP servers Start your first conversation: Try basic workflows like planning your day or researching a topic During the alpha period, we're particularly interested in feedback about: Which integrations are most valuable for your workflow What additional MCP servers you'd like to see supported natively How the voice interaction feels compared to traditional interfaces What new capabilities would make 11ai essential for your daily routine As we gather feedback and iterate on the platform, we'll be adding new integrations, improving the conversation flow, and expanding the actions 11ai can take on your behalf. As a proof of concept, 11ai demonstrates our vision for the future of human-computer interaction: natural conversation that results in meaningful action. We're excited to see how you experiment with voice-first productivity and what possibilities it opens for your workflows. Sign up for free access at 11.ai and experience this demonstration of voice-first productivity capabilities.",
