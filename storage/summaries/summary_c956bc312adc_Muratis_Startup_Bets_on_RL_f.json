TML has revealed that its focus is on creating custom AI solutions designed to help businesses increase revenue. Investors have described TML\u2019s business model as \u201cRL for businesses\u201d, reflecting the startup\u2019s emphasis on tailoring AI to business-specific metrics and needs.

The company may charge a premium for these highly customised models. While TML\u2019s business focus is on enterprise AI, the startup also plans to develop a consumer-facing product.

TML, in its launch blog post , revealed that the startup has hired top-tier AI researchers and engineers from leading companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.

  "tiktok_summary": "This acquisition just shocked the entire industry: Thinking Machines Lab, the AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, has raised $2 billion at a $10 billion valuation in under five months. That's right, folks, we're talking about a valuation that's more than double its pre-funding value. And investors are going crazy for it - Andreessen Horowitz led the round, throwing down a whopping $1.8 billion. But here's the thing, this deal isn't just about the cash injection; it's about what TML plans to do with it. According to the author, TML's focus is on creating custom AI solutions for businesses. They want to tailor AI to specific industries, like customer support, retail, and investment banking. It's like they're saying, \"Hey, we know you've got unique pain points, let us fix it.\" The CEO explains that these solutions will be designed to increase revenue, but how exactly? Well, that's still a bit of a mystery. Here's where things get really spicy: TML's approach is all about using reinforcement learning for business. Think of it like a game of poker - the AI learns from your moves and adapts to beat you. Or, in this case, it helps businesses win. According to the author, this is going to revolutionize the way companies operate. Wait, what? Is it possible that AI can actually help businesses make more money? Now, we're not talking about your grandma's bingo night here; we're talking about major corporations like Goldman Sachs and Microsoft. These are the big players, and if TML can deliver on its promises, watch out. The potential impact is huge.",
