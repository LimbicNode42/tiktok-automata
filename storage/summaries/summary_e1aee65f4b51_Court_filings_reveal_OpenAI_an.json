  "title": "Court filings reveal OpenAI and io's early work on an AI device",
  "original_content": "Legal filings submitted earlier this month from lawyers representing OpenAI and Jony Ive\u2019s io reveal new details about the companies\u2019 efforts to build a mass-market AI hardware device. The filings are part of a trademark dispute lawsuit filed this month by iyO, a Google-backed hardware startup developing custom-molded earpieces that connect to other devices. Over the weekend, OpenAI pulled promotional materials related to its $6.5 billion acquisition of Jony Ive\u2019s io startup in order to comply with a court order involved in the suit. OpenAI says it\u2019s fighting iyO\u2019s allegations of trademark infringement. For the last year, OpenAI executives and former Apple leaders now working at io have vigorously researched in-ear hardware devices, according to filings submitted in iyO\u2019s lawsuit. In a June 12 filing , lawyers representing OpenAI and io said the companies purchased at least 30 headphone sets from various companies to explore what\u2019s on the market today. In recent months, OpenAI and io executives also met with iyO\u2019s leadership and demoed their in-ear technology, according to emails revealed in the case. That said, OpenAI\u2019s first device in collaboration with io may not be a pair of headphones at all. Tang Tan, a longtime Apple executive who co-founded io and serves as the startup\u2019s chief hardware officer, claims in a declaration to the court that the prototype OpenAI CEO Sam Altman mentioned in io\u2019s launch video \u201cis not an in-ear device, nor a wearable device.\u201d Tan notes that the design of said prototype in not yet finalized and that the product is at least a year away from being advertised or offered for sale. The form factor of OpenAI and io\u2019s first hardware device has largely remained a mystery. Altman merely stated in io\u2019s launch video that the startup was working to create a \u201cfamily\u201d of AI devices with various capabilities, and Ive said io\u2019s first prototype \u201ccompletely captured\u201d his imagination. Altman had previously told OpenAI\u2019s employees at a meeting that the company\u2019s prototype, when finished, would be able to fit in a pocket or sit on a desk, according to the Wall Street Journal . The OpenAI CEO reportedly said the device would be fully aware of a user\u2019s surroundings and that it would be a \u201cthird device\u201d for consumers to use alongside their smartphone and laptop.

Boston, MA | July 15 REGISTER NOW \u201cOur intent with this collaboration was, and is, to create products that go beyond traditional products and interfaces,\u201d said Altman in a declaration to the court submitted on June 12. Lawyers representing OpenAI also said in a filing that the company has explored a wide range of devices, including ones that were \u201cdesktop-based and mobile, wireless and wired, wearable and portable.\u201d While smart glasses have emerged as the front-runner for AI-enabled devices, with companies like Meta and Google racing to develop the first broadly adopted pair, several companies are also exploring AI-enabled headphones. Apple is reportedly working on a pair of AirPods with cameras , which would help power AI features by gathering information about the surrounding environment. In recent months, OpenAI and io executives have done considerable research into in-ear products. On May 1, OpenAI\u2019s VP of Product, Peter Welinder, and Tan met with iyO\u2019s CEO, Jason Rugolo, to learn more about iyO\u2019s in-ear product, according to an emailed invitation revealed in the case. The meeting took place at io\u2019s office in Jackson Square, the San Francisco neighborhood where Ive has bought several buildings to work on LoveFrom and io. At the meeting, Welinder and Tan tested out iyO\u2019s custom-fit earpiece but were disappointed when the product failed repeatedly during demonstrations, according to follow-up emails revealed in the case. Tan claims in his declaration that he met with Rugolo as a courtesy to his mentor, longtime Apple executive Steve Zadesky, who recommended he take the meeting. Tan also claims he took several precautions to avoid learning too much about iyO\u2019s IP, such as suggesting that his lawyers review materials before he does. However, it seemed that OpenAI and io employees thought they could learn something from one of iyO\u2019s partners. To customize its in-ear headsets, iyO sent a specialist from an ear-scanning company, The Ear Project, to someone\u2019s home or office to get a detailed map of someone\u2019s ear. In one email revealed in the case , Marwan Rammah, a former Apple engineer who\u2019s now working at io, told Tan that purchasing a large database of three-dimensional scans from The Ear Project could give the company a \u201chelpful starting point on ergonomics.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if any such deal took place. Rugolo tried repeatedly to forge a deeper relationship between iyO, io, and OpenAI \u2014 but largely failed, according to the emails. He pitched OpenAI on launching iyO\u2019s device as an early \u201cdeveloper kit\u201d for its final AI device. He pitched OpenAI on investing in iyO and, at one point, even offered to sell his entire company for $200 million, the filings say. However, Tan said in his declaration that he declined these offers. Evans Hankey, former Apple executive turned io co-founder and chief product officer, said in a declaration to the court that io is not working on a \u201ccustom-molded earpiece product.\u201d The ChatGPT maker seems to be more than a year out from selling its first hardware device, which may not be an in-ear product whatsoever. Given what the company said in this lawsuit, it appears it is also exploring other form factors.",
  "tiktok_summary": "This acquisition just shocked the entire industry: OpenAI just bought Jony Ive's io, the company behind those crazy-sounding earpieces! So, you know how everyone's been talking about smart glasses and augmented reality? Well, OpenAI has been secretly working on something even crazier - a mass-market AI-powered earpiece! But here's the thing: they're not just stopping at software. They're building their own hardware. Like, they've been researching in-ear headphones for over a year! Apparently, OpenAI execs and former Apple leaders at io have been buying up headphone sets from all over the place - at least 30 different brands. They want to know what's out there, what works, what doesn't, and how they can make it better. Now, you might be thinking, \"Wait, isn't this just another smartwatch or smart speaker?\" Nope! This is a whole new level of personal computing. Imagine having a tiny computer right in your ear, processing information, learning your habits... it's like something straight out of science fiction! But here's where it gets absolutely insane: these earpieces aren't just for listening to music or podcasts. No way! They're designed to integrate seamlessly with your existing devices, so you can get notifications, control your home, and even access the internet without needing a phone. And if that's not wild enough, OpenAI's already made some major moves to get ahead of the competition. Just this week, they pulled down all their promo materials related to the acquisition, citing a court order in a trademark dispute with a rival company called iyO.",
