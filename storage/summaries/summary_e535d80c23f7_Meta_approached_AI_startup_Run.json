The social media giant invested $14.3 billion into Scale AI in June, and it has also approached the startups Safe Superintelligence and Perplexity AI about potential acquisitions this year. Meta agreed to a 49% stake in Scale AI and hired away founder Alexandr Wang along with a few other employees from the company. While Meta was unsuccessful in its efforts to buy Superintelligence outright, Daniel Gross, the company's CEO, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman are joining Meta's AI efforts, where they will work on products under Wang.

  "tiktok_summary": "This buyout is either the deal of the century or total madness: Meta just tried to swoop in and buy up another AI startup called Runway. Meta, the social media giant, was reportedly interested in acquiring Runway, but the talks didn't quite go as planned. Apparently, they were willing to make a pretty penny - we're talking billions - for the chance to get their hands on some top-notch AI talent. But here's the thing: Runway isn't just any ordinary AI startup. They're known for their game-changing AI video-generation tools, which have already caught the attention of some major players in the industry. Wait, what? You might be thinking, \"How does an AI-powered video generator work?\" Well, basically, these tools can create entire videos from scratch using nothing more than a few lines of code. It sounds like science fiction, right? The crazy part? That's not even the wildest part: Meta's interest in Runway comes at a time when they've already sunk a whopping $14.3 billion into another AI startup called Scale AI. Are you ready for another surprise? Yeah, I thought so. Scale AI is all about developing cutting-edge AI systems that can learn and adapt like humans do. And with Meta's massive investment, they're essentially putting all their eggs in one basket - or rather, one AI bucket. But will it pay off? Now, you might be wondering why Meta would bother trying to acquire Runway if they're already investing so heavily in AI. Well, the answer lies in the fact that Runway's technology could give Meta a serious edge in the competitive world of social media.",
