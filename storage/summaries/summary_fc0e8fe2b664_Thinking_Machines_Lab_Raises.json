  "original_content": "Thinking Machines Lab, the secretive AI startup founded by OpenAI\u2019s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, has closed a $2 billion seed round , according to The Financial Times . The deal values the 6-month-old startup at $10 billion. The company\u2019s work remains unclear . The startup has leveraged Murati\u2019s reputation and other high-profile AI researchers who have joined the team to attract investors in what could be the largest seed round in history. According to sources familiar with the deal cited by the FT, Andreessen Horowitz led the round, with participation from Sarah Guo\u2019s Conviction Partners. Murati left OpenAI last September after leading the development of some of the company\u2019s most prominent AI products, including ChatGPT, DALL-E, and voice mode. Several of her former OpenAI colleagues have joined the new startup, including co-founder John Schulman. Murati is one of a handful of executives who left OpenAI after raising concerns about CEO Sam Altman\u2019s leadership in 2023. When the board ousted Altman in November of that year, Murati served as interim CEO before Altman was quickly reinstated.",
  "tiktok_summary": "This $2 funding round is breaking the internet! Think of it as a tidal wave of cash hitting the shores of artificial intelligence. Mira Murati, the former CTO of OpenAI, has raised a whopping $2 billion for her new venture, Thinking Machines Lab. That's right, we're talking a $2 BILLION dollar seed round! But here's the thing - we don't know what they're working on yet! It's like trying to crack a secret code. The Financial Times says the six-month-old startup is valued at a cool $10 billion. I mean, that's like, a whole lot of money! Now, you might be thinking, \"Wait, isn't Mira Murati the OG behind some of OpenAI's biggest hits, like ChatGPT and DALL-E?\" And you'd be RIGHT! She was the driving force behind those AI superstars. But, she left OpenAI back in September after some high-level drama. It's like she was running from the storm, but now she's building something new and exciting! But the real tea is this: who else is joining the party? We've got some big names, folks! John Schulman, co-founder of OpenAI, is on board too! What's going on? Is this some kind of coup? Are they making a move against Sam Altman, the current OpenAI CEO? Think about it... if Mira Murati and John Schulman are part of this team, it's like they're bringing their A-game. They're like the dynamic duo of AI! And let's not forget, Andreessen Horowitz and Sarah Guo's Conviction Partners are also in on the action. This is getting juicy! Did you hear? OpenAI's own CEO, Sam Altman, stepped down in 2023 after some major controversy.",
